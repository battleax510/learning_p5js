# Game Development Suite with p5.js

Welcome to the Game Development Suite, a collection of interactive games designed to help students interested in gaming understand coding and basic game development using p5.js.

## About

This repository serves as an educational resource to introduce students to JavaScript programming through game development. Each game in the suite is built using the p5.js library, providing an accessible and creative environment for learning coding concepts.

## Games Included

- **Game 1: [mbros level 1]**
- In Level 1 of Super Mario Bros for the Nintendo, players start in the iconic "1-1" stage. The level introduces players to fundamental mechanics and elements that become staples throughout the game. Here's a brief description:

- **Setting:** The level is set in the Mushroom Kingdom, featuring a visually vibrant and horizontally scrolling environment.

- **Obstacles:** Players encounter various obstacles, including Goombas (small brown enemies), Koopa Troopas (turtles), pipes, and platforms.

- **Power-ups:** The level introduces the Super Mushroom, allowing Mario to grow in size. Obtaining the Super Mushroom grants Mario the ability to break blocks with his head.

- **Coins:** Players collect coins scattered throughout the level. Collecting 100 coins rewards players with an extra life.

- **Flagpole Finish:** The level concludes with Mario reaching the end-of-level flagpole. Players can earn points based on the height at which Mario grabs the flag.

- **Time Limit:** To add urgency, there is a time limit, and players can earn additional time by grabbing the flagpole.

- **Warp Zone:** A secret Warp Zone can be accessed by entering a specific pipe, providing players with the option to skip ahead to later levels.

Overall, Level 1 of Super Mario Bros serves as a tutorial, introducing players to key gameplay elements and establishing the foundation for the challenges they will face in subsequent levels.

- **Game 2: [Name]**
  - Brief description of the second game.

## Getting Started

Your `sketch.js` file contains code for a p5.js game where various elements are defined and manipulated. Let's break down some key aspects of the code:

### 1. Setup Function:
- The `setup` function initializes the canvas, creates instances of various game objects (e.g., `Jatekos`, `Talaj_fal`, `Grafika`), and sets some initial conditions.

    ```javascript
    function setup() {
      createCanvas(705, 607.5);
      // Create instances of game objects
      jatekos = new Jatekos();
      talaj_fal = new Talaj_fal();
      grafika = new Grafika();
      // ... (other objects)
    }
    ```

### 2. Draw Function:
- The `draw` function is called continuously and handles the main logic of your game. It includes rendering background, game elements, checking conditions, and updating the display.

    ```javascript
    function draw() {
      background(92, 136, 252);
      grafika.kfmegjelenites();
      palya_vege.megjelenites();
      // ... (other game elements)

      // Example: Display the player character
      if (jatekos.halal == false && palya_vege.vx - jatekos.x > 5) {
        jatekos.megjelenites();
      }
      // ... (other game logic)
    }
    ```

### 3. Key and Mouse Input Handling:
- Functions like `keyPressed`, `keyReleased`, and `mousePressed` handle user input to control the player character and trigger actions.

    ```javascript
    function keyPressed() {
      // Handle key presses
    }

    function keyReleased() {
      // Handle key releases
    }

    function mousePressed() {
      // Handle mouse presses
    }
    ```

### 4. Game Object Instances:
- Instances of various game objects (e.g., `Jatekos`, `Talaj_fal`, `Grafika`) are created in the `setup` function. These objects likely represent different aspects of your game, such as the player character, ground, graphics, etc.

### 5. Game Logic:
- The code contains logic for displaying game elements (e.g., characters, obstacles), handling user input, and checking conditions (e.g., whether the player has died or reached the end of the level).

### 6. Iteration and Looping:
- The code includes loops (e.g., `for` loops) for iterating through elements and updating their positions or states over time.

Remember to check the implementation details of each object (e.g., `Jatekos`, `Talaj_fal`, etc.) to understand how they contribute to the overall functionality of your game. The provided code represents a snapshot of your game's logic and behavior. If you have specific questions or need assistance with a particular part of the code, feel free to ask!
