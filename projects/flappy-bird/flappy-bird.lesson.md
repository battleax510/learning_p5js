### Lesson: Introduction to JavaScript with a Flappy Bird Game

#### 1. **Variables and Constants:**
   - Introduce the concept of variables (`let` and `const`).
   - Explain how variables store data and constants hold values that don't change.
   ```javascript
   let move_speed = 1;
   const gravity = 0.5;
   ```

#### 2. **DOM Manipulation:**
   - Discuss how JavaScript interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM).
   - Explain the use of `document.querySelector` to select and manipulate HTML elements.
   ```javascript
   let bird = document.querySelector('.bird');
   ```

#### 3. **Event Listeners:**
   - Introduce event listeners to respond to user actions.
   - Explain how to use `document.addEventListener` to listen for key events.
   ```javascript
   document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => { /* ... */ });
   ```

#### 4. **Functions:**
   - Cover the basics of declaring and calling functions.
   - Emphasize the structure and purpose of functions in the code.
   ```javascript
   function startBackgroundMusic() { /* ... */ }
   ```

#### 5. **Game State Management:**
   - Teach how to use variables to manage the state of a game.
   - Discuss conditional statements for different game states.
   ```javascript
   let game_state = 'Start';
   ```

#### 6. **Animating Elements:**
   - Explain the use of `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations.
   - Show how to create functions for continuous movement.
   ```javascript
   requestAnimationFrame(move);
   ```

#### 7. **Collision Detection:**
   - Introduce the concept of collision detection using `getBoundingClientRect`.
   - Discuss how to check for collisions between game elements.
   ```javascript
   if (bird_props.left < pipe_sprite_props.left + pipe_sprite_props.width && /* ... */) { /* ... */ }
   ```

#### 8. **Sound Effects:**
   - Discuss how to integrate sound effects using the `Audio` object.
   - Show how to play sound effects at specific events in the game.
   ```javascript
   let sound_point = new Audio('sounds effect/point.mp3');
   ```

#### 9. **Game Loop:**
   - Explain the concept of a game loop for continuous gameplay.
   - Emphasize the use of functions for different aspects of the game loop.
   ```javascript
   function play() { /* ... */ }
   ```

#### 10. **Reload Page on Game Over:**
   - Show how to reload the page to restart the game after a game-over condition.
   - Discuss the use of `window.location.reload()` for this purpose.
   ```javascript
   window.location.reload();
   ```

#### 11. **Encapsulation:**
   - Discuss the organization of code into functions for better readability and maintainability.
   - Emphasize the use of functions to encapsulate specific functionalities.
   ```javascript
   function apply_gravity() { /* ... */ }
   ```

This lesson provides an overview of key JavaScript concepts using the flappy bird game code as a practical example. Students can explore these concepts and build upon them to create their own interactive web games.
