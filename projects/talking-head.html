<!-- 

The Talking head simulator will use shapes to create a simple head with eyes nose and mouth.
The mouth will open by increasing the size of the mouth and decresing the mouth.
A button will be available on the canvas with the talking head when press will open and close the mouth.

Please create the initial script for us to start this process. 
The scripts should be in three parts
one part is for the HTML 
second part is the CSS
the third part is for the javascript this file should be named sketch.js
all files should be added to the html file so they can be accessible

the button should be below the talking head so the button doesn't cover the talking head

Next we will add a function to the button so the button simulates the mouth of the talking head to
open and close


Toggle Mouth button should be below the talking head
